    "Welcome! In this tutorial, you'll learn how to build a web research agent using [Tavily API](https://docs.tavily.com/documentation/api-reference/introduction) that can search, extract, crawl, and reason over live web data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These skills are essential for anyone building AI agents or applications that need up-to-date, relevant information from the internet. By learning how to programmatically access and process real-time web data, you'll be able to bridge the gap between static language models and the dynamic world they operate in, making your agents smarter, more accurate, and context-aware.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AWS Strands Agent Framework enables rapid development of AI agents with minimal code. Many research agent implementations require extensive development efforts and rely on deterministic logic with constrained inputs and outputs. Alternatively, Strands facilitates building highly dynamic agents through natural language. Strands agents leverage prompt engineering to dynamically generate varied output types and accept diverse natural language inputs seamlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core philosophy of Strands shifts complexity from hard-coded logic directly into the weights of the LLM, granting the model significant autonomy to determine agent behavior. This design approach ensures agents remain highly flexible and scalable, easily benefiting from advancements in new model releases. By simply integrating updated LLMs, developers can immediately unlock significant performance improvements without needing to modify any existing agent logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you'll know how to:\n",
    "- Connect agents to the web for up-to-date research\n",
    "- Orchestrate the web tools dynamically with the Strands agent framework\n",
    "- Build dynamic research agents capable of performing a range of tasks, including deep research, report writing, direct question answering, list building, etc.\n",

    "Now let‚Äôs use Tavily to crawl a webpage and extract all its links. Web crawling is the process of automatically navigating through websites by following hyperlinks to discover numerous web pages and URLs (think of it like falling down a Wikipedia rabbit hole üêá‚Äîclicking from page to page, diving deeper into interconnected topics). For autonomous web agents, this capability is essential for accessing deep web data which might be difficult to retrieve via search. \n",

    "\n",
    "We'll wrap the Tavily crawl endpoint in the Strands `@tool` decorator, similar to the search tool. We implement a `format_crawl_results_for_agent` helper function which parses Tavily search results into a clear, structured format that's easy for the LLM to process. \n",
    "\n",
    "The agent will have the ability to set the crawled url and the crawl instruction. You can adjust parameters such as the crawl depth, limit, and domain filters to tailor your crawl. For more information, read the crawl [API reference](https://docs.tavily.com/documentation/api-reference/endpoint/crawl) and [best practices guide](https://docs.tavily.com/documentation/best-practices/best-practices-crawl)."

Customers use SFTP endpoints to either upload files to or download files from SAP Concur using a File Transmission Service over the Internet securely (SFTP is an industry standard Secure File Transmission Protocol). SAP Concur SFTP Service is called IFM (Integrated File Management). Some examples of uploads could be lists of employees that need user profiles in SAP Concur to create Expense Reports, book Travel or approve Invoices. Prime example of download (or Extracts as they are typically called in SAP Concur documentation) is the SAE (Standard Accounting Extract) that is used by customers to import into their internal Financial Systems to input into General Ledger and use for Financial Close processes for month, quarter and year. Why are we moving to AWS Transfer So far, customers have been using SFTP endpoints in our legacy Datacenter. However, as a result of the recent migration to AWS by SAP Concur that has been previously communicated to all customers, the SFTP endpoints will also have to migrate to Amazon AWS; the specific service of AWS that hosts these SFTP endpoints is called AWS Transfer. General guidance from SAP Concur on the AWS migration is available here. Why is this change going into effect? The SFTP endpoint switch to AWS Transfer for a customer will be after the customer‚Äôs SAP Concur services and data have been moved to AWS. The SFTP migration project team has no prior knowledge of when a customer will be migrated to AWS; but once the project team is notified that a batch of customers have been migrated to AWS, we will soon thereafter communicate via email to that batch of customers to switch endpoints. Customers will be given a window of days starting from the date they receive our email communication to make the switch. What are the benefits of this change? The SFTP endpoint change to AWS Transfer is necessary to allow customers to continue using this File Transmission Service (inbound/outbound). The SFTP endpoints in the current legacy Datacenter will be shut down soon as it is part of an overall initiative to retire the legacy Datacenter. This change will not affect the user experience of using SFTP feature of SAP Concur for either Admins or End-users. Operational Guidance for Executing Required Change These instructions are for both your Production Entity and any Test Entity you may have with SAP Concur ‚Äì both Production and Test entity SFTP endpoints must be switched. Step 1: Open the AWS File Transfer Guide and have it ready for reference Review the SAP Concur AWS File Transfer Guide Step 2: Find out which data center you are implemented on Sign into SAP Concur solutions and scroll to the bottom of the web page. You will see a link for ‚ÄúService Status‚Äù and then your DC listed between the parentheses. Here are examples for how to know which data center your entity is currently on: ‚Ä¢ North America: Current private DC (Legacy) ‚Ä¢ EMEA: Current private DC (Legacy) ‚Ä¢ US2: New AWS region ‚Ä¢ EU2: New AWS region Once your entity is migrated, the DC listed in this area will switch over to the new one. This terminology also applies to how you would review your data center service status on Concur Open. Step 3: Make changes (if needed) to the ACL (Access Control List) ‚Ä¢ Action needed by SAP Concur: None. SAP Concur AWS Transfer does not utilize an ACL, so there is no need to provide us with your IP‚Äôs. ‚Ä¢ Action needed by your organization: You may need to add our SAP Concur AWS Transfer endpoint URL or IP addresses to your ACL, check with your Networking group. Step 4: Make changes as needed to abide by our Connection rules ‚Ä¢ SFTP with SSH key authentication is mandatory. ‚Ä¢ SSH keys must be RSA format, DSS formatted keys are not allowed. ‚Ä¢ Use your same User ID and SSH key as you currently use on the legacy data center (DC) (RSA only). ‚Ä¢ You may need to add or accept our new SSH Server fingerprint. ‚Ä¢ You may need to make changes to custom or third party SFTP Applications you are using currently to connect to SAP Concur SFTP Transmission Service. Refer to the link in Step 7 for more information. ‚Ä¢ Any service using your SAP Concur file transfer credentials needs to update to the new endpoints. Step 5: Make note of the following advice regarding Directories/Files ‚Ä¢ Legacy /in, /out, and current root folder data will not be copied to AWS Transfer. ‚Ä¢ Files you perform actions on in the legacy DC (e.g. delete, copy, move, rename) will not be reflected in AWS Transfer, and vice versa. ‚Ä¢ Ongoing until our legacy environment is retired, you will see the same files in your /out folder for both your legacy and AWS Transfer environments. ‚Ä¢ Make note of the files you downloaded from the legacy DC before switching to the new AWS Transfer endpoint, so you don‚Äôt download the same files from AWS Transfer causing duplicates. ‚Ä¢ You may see files that you uploaded to your /in folder...\\n\\nResponse time: 0.01 seconds'}]}}]},\n",

Data Extraction Processes\\nSFTP facilitates essential data downloads including:\\n- Standard Accounting Extract (SAE) for:\\n  * Financial system integration\\n  * General ledger updates\\n  * Period-end closing procedures [2]\\n- Intelligence report retrieval [3]\\n- Detailed expense report extraction [3]\\n\\n### 3. System Integration Requirements\\nSFTP serves as a crucial integration mechanism by:\\n- Enabling automated data exchange between SAP Concur and external systems [2]\\n- Supporting real-time data synchronization requirements [2]\\n- Facilitating secure automated business processes [1]\\n\\n## Technical Considerations\\nCritical security update as of April 2021: SAP Concur exclusively supports SFTP connections with SSH key authentication [3]. Legacy protocols and password-based SFTP authentication are no longer supported.\\n\\n## Conclusions\\nSFTP plays a fundamental role in SAP Concur's ecosystem, primarily serving three critical functions: data upload, information extraction, and system integration. The protocol's secure nature, particularly with mandatory SSH key authentication, makes it essential for maintaining data security while enabling automated business processes.\\n\\n## Sources\\n[1] AWS Transfer for SFTP Migration FAQ, SAP Concur\\n[2] Integration Options with SAP Concur, SAP Concur Blog\\n[3] Working with Your SAP Concur FTP Site, SAP Help Portal\\n\"}]}}]},\n",

Customers use SFTP endpoints to either upload files to or download files from SAP Concur using a File Transmission Service over the Internet securely (SFTP is an industry standard Secure File Transmission Protocol). SAP Concur SFTP Service is called IFM (Integrated File Management). Some examples of uploads could be lists of employees that need user profiles in SAP Concur to create Expense Reports, book Travel or approve Invoices. Prime example of download (or Extracts as they are typically called in SAP Concur documentation) is the SAE (Standard Accounting Extract) that is used by customers to import into their internal Financial Systems to input into General Ledger and use for Financial Close processes for month, quarter and year. Why are we moving to AWS Transfer So far, customers have been using SFTP endpoints in our legacy Datacenter. However, as a result of the recent migration to AWS by SAP Concur that has been previously communicated to all customers, the SFTP endpoints will also have to migrate to Amazon AWS; the specific service of AWS that hosts these SFTP endpoints is called AWS Transfer. General guidance from SAP Concur on the AWS migration is available here. Why is this change going into effect? The SFTP endpoint switch to AWS Transfer for a customer will be after the customer‚Äôs SAP Concur services and data have been moved to AWS. The SFTP migration project team has no prior knowledge of when a customer will be migrated to AWS; but once the project team is notified that a batch of customers have been migrated to AWS, we will soon thereafter communicate via email to that batch of customers to switch endpoints. Customers will be given a window of days starting from the date they receive our email communication to make the switch. What are the benefits of this change? The SFTP endpoint change to AWS Transfer is necessary to allow customers to continue using this File Transmission Service (inbound/outbound). The SFTP endpoints in the current legacy Datacenter will be shut down soon as it is part of an overall initiative to retire the legacy Datacenter. This change will not affect the user experience of using SFTP feature of SAP Concur for either Admins or End-users. Operational Guidance for Executing Required Change These instructions are for both your Production Entity and any Test Entity you may have with SAP Concur ‚Äì both Production and Test entity SFTP endpoints must be switched. Step 1: Open the AWS File Transfer Guide and have it ready for reference Review the SAP Concur AWS File Transfer Guide Step 2: Find out which data center you are implemented on Sign into SAP Concur solutions and scroll to the bottom of the web page. You will see a link for ‚ÄúService Status‚Äù and then your DC listed between the parentheses. Here are examples for how to know which data center your entity is currently on: ‚Ä¢ North America: Current private DC (Legacy) ‚Ä¢ EMEA: Current private DC (Legacy) ‚Ä¢ US2: New AWS region ‚Ä¢ EU2: New AWS region Once your entity is migrated, the DC listed in this area will switch over to the new one. This terminology also applies to how you would review your data center service status on Concur Open. Step 3: Make changes (if needed) to the ACL (Access Control List) ‚Ä¢ Action needed by SAP Concur: None. SAP Concur AWS Transfer does not utilize an ACL, so there is no need to provide us with your IP‚Äôs. ‚Ä¢ Action needed by your organization: You may need to add our SAP Concur AWS Transfer endpoint URL or IP addresses to your ACL, check with your Networking group. Step 4: Make changes as needed to abide by our Connection rules ‚Ä¢ SFTP with SSH key authentication is mandatory. ‚Ä¢ SSH keys must be RSA format, DSS formatted keys are not allowed. ‚Ä¢ Use your same User ID and SSH key as you currently use on the legacy data center (DC) (RSA only). ‚Ä¢ You may need to add or accept our new SSH Server fingerprint. ‚Ä¢ You may need to make changes to custom or third party SFTP Applications you are using currently to connect to SAP Concur SFTP Transmission Service. Refer to the link in Step 7 for more information. ‚Ä¢ Any service using your SAP Concur file transfer credentials needs to update to the new endpoints. Step 5: Make note of the following advice regarding Directories/Files ‚Ä¢ Legacy /in, /out, and current root folder data will not be copied to AWS Transfer. ‚Ä¢ Files you perform actions on in the legacy DC (e.g. delete, copy, move, rename) will not be reflected in AWS Transfer, and vice versa. ‚Ä¢ Ongoing until our legacy environment is retired, you will see the same files in your /out folder for both your legacy and AWS Transfer environments. ‚Ä¢ Make note of the files you downloaded from the legacy DC before switching to the new AWS Transfer endpoint, so you don‚Äôt download the same files from AWS Transfer causing duplicates. ‚Ä¢ You may see files that you uploaded to your /in folder...\\n\\nResponse time: 0.01 seconds'}]}}]},\n",
